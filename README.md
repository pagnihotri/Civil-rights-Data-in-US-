# Civil-rights-Data-in-US-
The data set I have worked with is called the Civil Rights Data Collection. 
It contains information on educational achievement and opportunities in the U.S., 
broken down by race and school. For example, it records the racial composition of the 
students enrolled in advanced classes at each school. Each row represents a school, 
while each column records an indicator of academic achievement.
For the purposes of this project, I have used a subset of the data that only contains 1 
out of every 100 rows in the original data set and did some analysis to find out the percentage
of enrollment for different races and gender and compared them to US demographics.
